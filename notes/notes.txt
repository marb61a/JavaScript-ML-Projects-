Conversational AI + NLP
    - Python has a lot of AI libraries
    - JavaScript has libraries which will help avoid having to work through Python\API

NLP - Natural Language Processing
    - This is the study of the interactions between computers and human languages
    - It is a huge area and constantly evolving
    - It is not just a sub area of AI but also Computation and Linguistics

NLU - Natural Language Understanding
    - A group of techniques to convert non-structured inputs in natural language in structured inputs that can be managed by a computer
        - For example different languages have different ways of constructing sentences, some put the verb before the subject others the opposite approach
    - One application is classification
        - This is the most important part of a chatbot

NLG - Natural Language Generator
    - This converts computer output into natural language
        - This will include gender, plurals, context etc
        - For example User has 1 new message and User has 2 new messages

NER - Named Entity Recognition
    - This extracts entities from natural language sentences
        - It will recognise numbers, dates, emails, hashtags etc
        - Numbers when declared numerically are the same in multiple languages eg 500
        - This changes when the number is stated using alphabetical characters eg five hundred
        - This means different extraction methods for different languages for dates, numbers, currencties etc

Utterance
    - This is a sentence in a natural language
    - Usually utterances can be thought of as the sentences used to train a bot or by users

Intent
    - This is each of the different things that a chatbot knows how to answer
    - When an utterance is received NLU classifies the utterance into intents

Entity
    - If intents are the various actions that a chatbot can execute
        - then entities are the parameters that can be extracted from the utterances to provide arguments for actions
    - For example if a chatbot can understand the intent "eat" and a person say "I want to eat pizza" then pizza is an entity
    - Intents can be thought of as functions and entities as their parameters

Corpus
    -

!!! When writing in a foreign language there may be special character which even native speakers may forget to add
    - For example there are a couple of above vowel characters in French called accents, in Spanish too and others
    - These change both the sound and in some case meaning of words so is important to remember
